# Bootstrap Combobox Blur

This is a fork of [danielfarrell/bootstrap-combobox] which alters the comboboxs' blur event handling. Instead of clearing the placeholder field on blur, we keep the user's input in the field. In addition, if only one option matches the placeholder's value on blur, that option is selected.
